However, most countries are far from being on track to meet these targets.", "Children in the Central African Republic, Chad, Nigeria, Guinea, and Guinea Bissau are the most at risk, the index revealed, but pointed out that these countries are not among those responsible for creating the problem. The report puts the blame on 10 countries that are responsible for nearly 70 per cent of global emissions.\u00a0", "Current impacts on children", "Lack of healthcare, education, water, and sanitation are some of the essentials the children who are exposed to multiple, overlapping climate and environmental risks that trigger.\u00a0", "820 million children (over one-third of children globally) are currently highly exposed to heatwaves, according to the Children\u2019s Climate Risk Index. 2020 was recorded as the hottest year on record.\u00a0", "Nearly 1 in 6 children globally, 400 million children, are currently highly exposed to cyclones that are increasing in frequency. Cyclone patterns shift causing rainfall intensity to grow.", "Riverine flooding is currently affecting 330 million children, 1 in 7 children globally. As the high water content in the atmosphere causes glaciers to continue melting, this number is feared to get worse.", "As a result, 240 million children, 1 in 10 children, are highly exposed to coastal floodings. Rising sea levels are magnified storm surges also being added to the equation.\u00a0", "But while water floods kill people, 920 children are experiencing a lack of access to water. Frequency and severity of droughts, water stress, seasonal and interannual variability and contamination are among the causes of water scarcity as a result of climate change.", "Fighting vector-borne diseases is much harder under worsening climate conditions that create a perfect environment for mosquitos and pathogens to transmit more diseases. 600 million, more than 1 in 4 children, are already highly exposed to such diseases.\u00a0", "Almost 90 per cent of children globally, 2 billion children, are currently highly exposed to air pollution.\u00a0", "Children fighting for children", "Four children climate activists, Adriana Calder\u00f3n from Mexico, Farzana Faruk Jhumu, from Bangladesh, Eric Njuguna from Kenya, Greta Thunberg from Sweden launched the report and called for action.\u00a0", "\u201cClimate change is the greatest threat facing the world\u2019s children and young people.
